  <h2> What is Career Development? </h2> 

  <p>Career development is the process of learning and utilizing short-term skills to progress
     toward long-term professional goals. This process is often lifelong and involves steadily
     reaching milestones specific to your designated career path. Much of career development calls for reflection and
     the exploration of purpose in your work, and is the foundation for achieving larger career growth. </p>

   <p>A career path can be visualized as a ladder, with each rung symbolizing the level of a role on the path. 
      Landing a job is a  paramount first step, but odds are you may not want to stay at the entry level forever.
       Moving up the career ladder and earning promotions is easier said than done, however.
      It often requires careful planning and taking intentional steps.</p>

    <p>Career development is all about gathering what skills and experiences can launch you further on your career path, 
        and navigating these processes in increments (or ladder steps) to make career growth manageable.</p>
